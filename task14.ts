14.//	Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


const guestlist:string[] = ["saad","khan","huzaifa"];
function sendDinnerInvitation (name:string):string{

    return `Dear ${name},\n\nYou are cordially invited to a dinner gathering at my residence.

// Sending invitations to each guest
for (const guest of guestList) {
  const invitationMessage = sendDinnerInvitation(guest);
