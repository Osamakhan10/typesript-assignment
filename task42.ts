//42.	Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


function Great(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    const greatMagicians: string[] = [];
    for (const magician of magicians) {
      const greatMagician = "the Great " + magician;
      greatMagicians.push(greatMagician);
    }
    return greatMagicians;
  }
  
  function Magicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (const magician of magicians) {
      console.log(magician);
    }
  }
  
  const magician : string[] = ["Magician 1", "Magician 2", "Magician 3"];
  const greatMagicianNames = makeGreat(magicianNames);
  
  showMagicians(greatMagicianNames);
